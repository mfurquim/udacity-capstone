# Capstone Proposal

People who operates in day trade have to analyze the previous days and recognize the stock movement patterns.
There is a certain limit to how much attention humans can give to tasks.
Opening multiple computer windows to operate on different companies' assets can be effortful.

Whereas, Machine Learning models are capable of recognizing patterns and make decisions faster.
Furthermore, it can be scaled to cover more stock options.

The proposal for this capstone is an app which will recommend stock operations to be concluded in the same day.

## Data

The dataset used is the _Huge Stock Price Data: Intraday Minute Bar_ by [MÃ¶bius](https://www.kaggle.com/arashnic) which can be found at [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arashnic/stock-data-intraday-minute-bar) and [github](https://github.com/FutureSharks/financial-data/tree/master/pyfinancialdata).

The data used to train the model will be the minute-by-minute data of stocks.
Among many others, the stocks can be:

```
$ tree -L 2 data/stocks
data/stocks/
\-- histdata/
    |-- ETXEUR/
    |-- GRXEUR/
    |-- JPXJPY/
    |-- SPXUSD/
    \-- README.md
```

Here is an example of the `EUR_USD`:

```python
import pyfinancialdata
data = pyfinancialdata.get(provider='oanda', instrument='EUR_USD', year=2017)
data.tail(3)
                       close     high      low     open  volume    price
date
2017-12-29 21:57:00  1.20045  1.20071  1.20004  1.20018      50  1.20045
2017-12-29 21:58:00  1.20041  1.20041  1.20041  1.20041       1  1.20041
2017-12-29 21:59:00  1.20039  1.20039  1.19970  1.20036      14  1.20039
```

The data will be explored and cleaned if necessary.
Then, it will be prepared and transformed to provide the model.

## Algorithms and models

A couple of algorithms will be defined and the models will be trained with different hyperparameters.
The models will be compared between themselves according to accuracy and efficiency.
The accuracy will be calculated by the root mean square error of the prediction and the real data.
The efficiency will be measured by calculating the possible profit by the end of the day.

One model will be chosen to be deployed to production.
An api will be developed to access the model and calculate the recommendation.
The api will then calculate the amount and whether to buy or sell the stock in order to have profit.

A report will be written structured as the examples given at [udacity/machine-learning](https://github.com/udacity/machine-learning/tree/master/projects/capstone)
